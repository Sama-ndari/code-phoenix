**CodePhoenix** is a "self-healing" multi-agent system designed to autonomously diagnose, research, and repair broken Python code. It mimics the workflow of a Senior Software Engineer by executing a strict **Research-Fix-Verify** loop within a secure execution environment.



## 🏗️ Architecture & Workflow
CodePhoenix utilizes a **Sequential Process** across three specialized agents:

1.  **🔍 The Investigator:** Analyzes `broken_script.py` and uses Google Search to find current solutions.
2.  **⚙️ The Engineer:** Implements the fix and runs it inside an isolated **Docker container**.
3.  **💼 The Manager:** Validates the result and sends a **Push Notification** to the user.



## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Prerequisites
* **Python 3.11+**
* **Docker Desktop:** [Download here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/). (Ensure it is running before starting the crew).
* **OpenAI API Key:** [Get it here](https://platform.openai.com/).

### 2. Configure External Tools (Optional but Recommended)
To enable the full "Autonomous" experience, sign up for these free tiers:
* **Serper (Search):** Go to [serper.dev](https://serper.dev/), sign up, and copy your API Key. This allows the agent to search Google/StackOverflow.
* **Pushover (Mobile Alerts):** 1. Install the Pushover app on your phone.
    2. Go to [pushover.net](https://pushover.net/) to get your **User Key**.
    3. Create an "Application" on the dashboard to get your **API Token**.

### 3. Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone [https://github.com/Sama-ndari/code_phoenix.git](https://github.com/Sama-ndari/code_phoenix.git)
cd code_phoenix

# Install dependencies
uv sync

```

### 4. Setup Environment (`.env`)

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and fill in your keys:

```ini
# Core LLM
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-xxxx

# Web Research (serper.dev)
SERPER_API_KEY=xxxx

# Mobile Notifications (pushover.net)
PUSHOVER_USER=xxxx
PUSHOVER_TOKEN=xxxx

```

## 🛠️ Usage

1. **Define the Problem:** Place any broken Python code into `broken_script.py` in the root folder.
2. **Run the Crew:**
```bash
uv run crewai run

```


3. **Observe:**
* The **Investigator** will log its research findings.
* The **Engineer** will create `fixed_script.py` and start a Docker container to test it.
* You will receive a **Push Notification** on your phone once the script is verified as working.



## 📂 Project Structure

* `src/code_phoenix/config/`: YAML files defining Agent personalities and Task sequences.
* `src/code_phoenix/tools/`: Custom Python tools (Pushover integration).
* `broken_script.py`: The input file the agents monitor.
* `fixed_script.py`: The final output generated by the Engineer.
